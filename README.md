# Image Recognition using PCA

In this project I've developed an image recognition engine using Matlab. The basic breakdown of the project is as follows:
* Performed Principal Component Analysis on a set of 32x32 8 bit facial images.
* Projected a set of training and test image into the Eigenspace.
* Calculated the distance and displayed 3 images among the trained image that best match the test image.
